## Slack Enterprise Grid
Slack Enterprise Grid is a paid Slack plan that allows you to connect multiple Slack workspaces into a single "grid" and share users between them. This is useful for large organizations that want to share users between multiple workspaces. For more information, see [Slack Enterprise Grid](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/115005265703-Slack-Enterprise-Grid).

We have two sandboxes for testing the Slack Enterprise Grid integration. Owner account is `support@texts.com`. Ask for access in the #platform-integrations channel.

- Organization ID: els1761a
- Organization ID: els1761b (uses SAML SSO w/ Google)

These organizations have multiple Slack teams within them that can share channels and users with same ID across the teams.
